## Chimera

Chimera is a smart contract property-based testing framework. Write once, run everywhere.

### Motivation

When writing property-based tests, developers commonly face several issues: 
- the amount of boilerplate code required
- the challenge of switching tools after the initial setup
- the difficulty in sharing results between different tools

Writing invariant tests that work seamlessly with Foundry, Echidna, Medusa, and Halmos is not straightforward. 

Chimera addresses this problem by enabling a "write once, run everywhere" approach.

### Features

- Boilerplate contracts for Foundry, Echidna, Medusa, and Halmos tests
- Scripts to convert results from one tool to another
- TBD
